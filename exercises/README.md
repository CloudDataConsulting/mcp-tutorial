# MCP Exercises

This directory contains hands-on exercises for learning MCP server development.

## Exercise List

1. **[Setup MCP Servers](1-setup-mcp-servers.md)** - Install and test both Node.js and Python servers in Claude Desktop

## How to Use These Exercises

1. Complete the language fundamentals tutorials first
2. Work through exercises in order
3. Each exercise builds on previous knowledge
4. Don't skip the debugging sections - they're important!

## What We've Proven

Before creating these exercises, we tested both servers:

### Node.js Server ✅
- Dependencies installed successfully with `npm install`
- Server runs without errors
- MCP Inspector can connect to it

### Python Server ✅
- Virtual environment created with `uv venv`
- Dependencies installed with `uv pip install`
- Server imports and runs correctly

### Claude Desktop Integration ✅
- Successfully added both servers to `claude_desktop_config.json`
- Correct paths and command formats verified
- Configuration restored after testing

This proves both implementations are working and ready for students to install!
